DIY KIT for the 4MS Sampler in 4U LW Format

Use from the kit the following components:
_ all 10 pin female headers
- switches
- sd card slot
- brainboard

Take off all soldered headers on the brainboards carefully. 
Solder a new 6pin single row header for the ADC/DAC shunting.
You can use straight pins or 90 degrees angles headers that go inwards.
Remember the position of the shunts or take a pciture. Place the shunts when done.

Solder the jumpers on the front pcb regarding the use of the original delivered switches or not.

I added some pictures to make it visual.

There is a small mod to do and this consists of soldering a wire between the 2 card slot holder pins and one body pin of the nearest potentiometer.
